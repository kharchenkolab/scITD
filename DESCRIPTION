Description: Employs the Tucker tensor decomposition method
    to extract multicell-type gene expression patterns that are variably
    expressed across donors/individuals in a single-cell dataset of interest.
    Extracted factors consist of a) a multi cell type loadings matrix and b) a
    corresponding donor scores vector indicating the level at which the corresponding
    loadings matrix is expressed in each donor. Additional methods are implemented
    to aid in selecting an appropriate number of factors and to evaluate stability
    of the decomposition. Other functions are included to improve interpretability of
    the results, and these include a jackstraw-like method for computing genes
    significantly associated with a factor as well as gene set enrichment analysis
    to understand the biological processes taking place in each cell type. Further
    methods are implemented to evaluate associations between factors and
    metadata variables as well as associations between factors and cell type/subtype
    proportions.
