## Introduction

Single-Cell Interpretable Tensor Decomposition (scITD) is computational
method capable of extracting multicellular gene expression programs that
vary across donors or samples. The approach is premised on the idea that
higher-level biological processes often involve the coordinated actions
and interactions of multiple cell types. Given single-cell expression
data from multiple heterogenous samples, scITD aims to detect these
joint patterns of dysregulation impacting multiple cell types. This
method has a wide range of potential applications, including the study
of inter-individual variation at the population-level, patient
sub-grouping/stratification, and the analysis of sample-level batch
effects. The multicellular information provided by our method allows one
to gain a deeper understanding of the ways that cells might be
interacting or responding to certain stimuli. To enable such insights,
we also provide an integrated suite of downstream data processing tools
to transform the scITD output into succinct, yet informative summaries
of the data.

## Installation

To install scITD from CRAN use:

``` r
install.packages('scITD')
```

To use the latest version of scITD from GitHub, install with the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kharchenkolab/scITD")
```

## Walkthrough

Follow the [walkthrough](http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/jonathan/) to
learn how to use scITD. The tutorial introduces the standard processing
pipeline and applies it to a dataset of PBMCâ€™s from 45 healthy donors.
