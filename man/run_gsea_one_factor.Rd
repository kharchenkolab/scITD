\usage{
run_gsea_one_factor(
  container,
  factor_select,
  method = "fgsea",
  thresh = 0.05,
  db_use = "GO",
  collapse_paths = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{container}{environment Project container that stores sub-containers
for each cell type as well as results and plots from all analyses}

\item{factor_select}{numeric The factor of interest}

\item{method}{character The method of gsea to use. Can either be "fgsea", 
"fgsea_special or "hypergeometric". (default="fgsea")}

\item{thresh}{numeric Pvalue significance threshold to use. Will include gene sets in
resulting heatmap if pvalue is below this threshold for at least one cell type. (default=0.05)}

\item{db_use}{character The database of gene sets to use. Database
options include "GO", "Reactome", "KEGG", and "BioCarta". More than
one database can be used. (default="GO")}

\item{collapse_paths}{logical Set to TRUE to collapse significant pathways with
considerable overlap. Only used if method="fgsea". (default=TRUE)}
}
\value{
a heatmap plot of the gsea results in the slot
container$plots$gsea$FactorX$up/down
}
