# scITD


Single-Cell Interpretable Tensor Decomposition (scITD) employs the Tucker tensor decomposition to extract multi-cell type expression programs from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. This tool is most useful for scRNA-seq datasets derived from many source donors. By rearranging the factor matrices and core tensor traditionally extracted with Tucker we create a biologically meaningful result that can be interpreted with standard methods such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). To further improve interpretability of the extracted factors we apply independent component analysis (ICA) to rotate factors toward independence. We also implement several methods to determine the appropriate ranks to decompose the tensor to, as this can be one of the main challenges in using such a method. Further, a jackstraw-like method has been implemented to identify genes that are significant in each of the extracted factors. Overall, this package provides the basic tools necessary to extracting multi-cell type processes from scRNA-seq datasets that will be useful in understanding complex and heterogeneous diseases.

## Installation

You can install scITD with the following function call:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kharchenkolab/scITD")
```

## Walkthrough

Follow the [guided tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kharchenkolab/scITD//master/doc/walkthrough.html) to learn how to use scITD. The tutorial walks through the standard pipeline and applies it to a dataset of PBMC's from 45 healthy donors. The dataset is originally from a paper by [van der Wijst et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905669/).
